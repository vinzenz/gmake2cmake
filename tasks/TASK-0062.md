<summary>Implement structured logging with proper rotation and metrics</summary>
<scope>
- Components: logging_config.py and all modules that perform logging
- Focus on structured logging, correlation IDs, and performance metrics
</scope>
<developer>
- Replace basic logging with structured logging (JSON format)
- Use structlog or python-json-logger library
- Add correlation IDs for request tracing across modules
- Configure log rotation with size and time limits
- Standardize log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Include context information (file, function, line number)
- Add timing information for performance tracking
- Support multiple outputs (file, console, syslog)
- Make log level configurable via environment variable
- Add performance metrics to critical operations
</developer>
<qe>
- Verify JSON log format is valid and parseable
- Test correlation IDs flow through entire pipeline
- Validate log rotation works at size/time limits
- Ensure all log levels are used appropriately
- Check performance metrics are accurate
- Verify logs can be ingested by log aggregation tools
</qe>
<reviewer>
- Confirm structured logging format is consistent
- Verify correlation IDs enable request tracing
- Check that sensitive data is not logged
- Ensure log levels follow best practices
- Validate performance overhead is minimal
- Confirm documentation explains logging configuration
</reviewer>
<tests>
- Unit tests for logging configuration
- Integration tests for correlation ID propagation
- Test log rotation triggers correctly
- Verify JSON format validity
- Performance tests for logging overhead
- Test environment variable configuration
</tests>
