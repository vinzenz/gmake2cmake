<summary>Implement deterministic ordering utilities.</summary>
<scope>
- Create gmake2cmake.utils.ordering module with deterministic sort functions.
- Provide stable sorting for targets, files, diagnostics, and dependencies.
- Implement topological sort for dependency graphs.
- Add natural sort for version numbers and file paths.
- Ensure all components use centralized ordering functions.</scope>
<developer>
- Implement stable_sort with configurable key functions.
- Create topological_sort handling partial orders and cycles.
- Add natural_sort for human-friendly ordering.
- Provide dependency_sort respecting build order requirements.
- Update all components to use ordering utilities.</developer>
<qe>
- Test ordering stability with identical keys.
- Verify topological sort with complex graphs.
- Test natural sort with mixed numeric/alpha strings.
- Validate identical output across multiple runs.
- Test performance with large datasets.</qe>
<reviewer>
- Check all sorting call sites updated.
- Verify no implicit ordering dependencies remain.
- Ensure sort stability documented clearly.
- Validate performance acceptable for large projects.</reviewer>
<tests>
- Commands: `pytest -q tests/utils/test_ordering.py`.</tests>
