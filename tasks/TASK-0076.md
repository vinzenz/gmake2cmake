<summary>Report make introspection outcomes in diagnostics and summary</summary>
<scope>
- Components: report generation (JSON/markdown), exit-code policy, logging
- Metrics: introspection_enabled flag, counts for validated/modified/mismatched targets, timeout/failure visibility
</scope>
<developer>
- Extend report payloads to include introspection summary fields (enabled, validated_count, modified_count, mismatch_count, failures).
- Surface introspection runner diagnostics and timing in console output when verbose; keep silent when disabled.
- Adjust exit-code logic if introspection failures should affect build status (document policy and keep backward compatible by default).
- Update README/help to describe new report fields and usage.
</developer>
<qe>
- Add tests asserting report.json/markdown contain the new fields with stable keys and values.
- Verify console output remains unchanged when introspection is off and includes summary when on.
- Validate exit codes for mismatch/timeout/failure align with documented policy.
</qe>
<reviewer>
- Confirm reporting schema changes are documented and deterministic.
- Ensure backward compatibility for existing report consumers (new fields additive only).
- Check that logging does not leak excessive dump data.

<tests>
- pytest tests/diagnostics/test_reporting.py
- pytest tests/e2e/test_cli_end_to_end.py (updated to cover introspection summary)
- Manual: gmake2cmake --use-make-introspection --report --dry-run on sample project
</tests>
