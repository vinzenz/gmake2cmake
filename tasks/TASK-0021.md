<summary>Add multiprocessing support for parallel evaluation.</summary>
<scope>
- Implement parallel processing in MakeEvaluator for independent Makefiles.
- Use multiprocessing.Pool with configurable process count from CLIArgs.
- Partition work based on include graph dependencies.
- Merge results deterministically preserving diagnostics and unknown constructs.
- Handle graceful degradation when multiprocessing unavailable.</scope>
<developer>
- Create work partitioner analyzing IncludeGraph for parallelizable chunks.
- Implement worker function for evaluating single Makefile with context.
- Add result merger combining BuildFacts/diagnostics/unknowns deterministically.
- Wire processes parameter from CLI through to evaluator.
- Ensure pickle-ability of all data structures passed to workers.</developer>
<qe>
- Test speedup on projects with many independent Makefiles.
- Verify identical output with processes=1 vs processes=N.
- Test graceful handling of worker failures.
- Validate resource cleanup and no zombie processes.</qe>
<reviewer>
- Check deterministic ordering maintained across parallel execution.
- Verify diagnostic context preserved correctly.
- Ensure no race conditions or shared state corruption.
- Validate fallback to serial processing when appropriate.</reviewer>
<tests>
- Commands: `pytest -q tests/test_parallel_evaluation.py -n auto`.</tests>
