<summary>Standardize exception handling patterns across the codebase</summary>
<scope>
- Components: All modules with exception handling, particularly parallel.py, schema_validator.py, cli.py, ir/patterns.py, cmake/emitter.py
- Focus on replacing bare except clauses and generic Exception catches with specific exceptions
</scope>
<developer>
- Replace bare except clauses in parallel.py:229,235 with specific exception types
- Replace generic Exception catches with specific exception types where possible
- Add proper logging/diagnostics for all caught exceptions
- Create custom exception hierarchy for domain-specific errors
- Use 'raise from' pattern to preserve exception context
- Ensure all exceptions are properly reported through DiagnosticCollector
- Document exception handling strategy in developer documentation
</developer>
<qe>
- Verify all bare except clauses have been replaced
- Test that exceptions are properly logged with context
- Ensure custom exceptions inherit from appropriate base classes
- Validate exception chaining works correctly
- Test error messages provide sufficient debugging information
</qe>
<reviewer>
- Confirm no bare except clauses remain in codebase
- Verify custom exception hierarchy makes semantic sense
- Check that all exceptions include proper context
- Ensure logging is consistent across all exception handlers
- Validate that silent failures have been eliminated
</reviewer>
<tests>
- Unit tests for custom exception classes
- Integration tests for exception propagation
- Verify DiagnosticCollector captures all errors
- Test exception context preservation
- Validate error messages are informative
</tests>
