<task id="TASK-0024">
<summary>Implement error recovery and partial conversion strategy.</summary>
<scope>
- Design error recovery mechanism allowing conversion to continue after non-fatal errors.
- Categorize errors as fatal (stop immediately) vs recoverable (continue with degraded output).
- Implement recovery points at component boundaries.
- Track partial conversion status in Project metadata.
- Generate CMake with clear markers for incomplete sections.</scope>
<developer>
- Add error_recovery_enabled flag to ConfigModel.
- Define fatal vs recoverable error categories in each component.
- Implement try-continue blocks at target/file granularity.
- Track conversion completeness percentage in diagnostics.
- Mark generated CMake sections with conversion status comments.</developer>
<qe>
- Test partial conversion with various error types.
- Verify fatal errors still stop processing.
- Test recovered output is valid CMake (if incomplete).
- Validate diagnostic reporting of partial conversion.
- Test with --strict flag disables recovery.</qe>
<reviewer>
- Verify recovery doesn't hide critical issues.
- Check generated CMake clearly indicates incomplete sections.
- Ensure recovery logic doesn't complicate debugging.
- Validate user can understand what was/wasn't converted.</reviewer>
<tests>
- Commands: `pytest -q tests/test_error_recovery.py`.</tests>
