<task id="TASK-0036">
<summary>Standardize exception handling across core modules.</summary>
<scope>
- Replace broad `except Exception` usages in CLI and config paths with targeted exception handling.
- Introduce a lightweight shared error hierarchy for expected failure modes (e.g., config, IO, pipeline).
- Ensure unhandled exceptions still surface as diagnostics with context.</scope>
<developer>
- Audit `gmake2cmake/cli.py` and `gmake2cmake/config.py` for generic catches; narrow them or re-raise after logging.
- Define common base exceptions (e.g., `Gmake2CmakeError`, `ConfigError`) if helpful and use them where appropriate.
- Keep pragma no-cover guards only where necessary; avoid swallowing KeyboardInterrupt.</developer>
<qe>
- Add tests to confirm specific exceptions raise/diagnose correctly without silent suppression; cover pipeline error path in CLI and config read/parse fallbacks.</qe>
<reviewer>
- Check that new exceptions don’t leak user-hostile stack traces and that diagnostics remain deterministic.</reviewer>
<tests>
- Commands: `ruff check . && pytest -q tests/test_cli.py tests/test_config_manager.py`.</tests>
