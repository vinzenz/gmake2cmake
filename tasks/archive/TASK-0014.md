<summary>Detect and report unmappable constructs in CMakeEmitter.</summary>
<scope>
- Extend `gmake2cmake.cmake.emitter` to create `UnknownConstruct` entries (category `toolchain_specific`/`other`) when target types or properties cannot be rendered cleanly.
- Emit `UNKNOWN_CONSTRUCT` diagnostics accordingly without aborting generation unless severity=ERROR.</scope>
<developer>
- Hook into render_target/render_packaging paths to flag unmappable cases; populate cmake_status and suggested_action.
- Thread UnknownConstruct collection through to CLI report alongside existing unknowns.</developer>
<qe>
- Add tests to simulate emitter unmappable cases and assert unknown_constructs presence and diagnostics; ensure dry-run/write paths unaffected.</qe>
<reviewer>
- Confirm consistency with UnknownConstruct model and reporting, deterministic ordering, and no regression of existing emitter behavior.</reviewer>
<tests>
- Commands: `ruff check . && pytest -q tests/emitter`.</tests>
