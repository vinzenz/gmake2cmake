<summary>Improve test coverage for critical paths and error handling</summary>
<scope>
- Components: All test modules, particularly for parallel.py, cache.py, profiling.py, schema_validator.py, ir/cycles.py, ir/patterns.py
- Focus on error paths, concurrent execution, and edge cases
</scope>
<developer>
- Remove pragma: no cover comments and add actual tests
- Implement tests for parallel worker pool operations
- Add cache eviction and TTL expiration tests
- Create property-based tests using hypothesis for parsers
- Add integration tests for complete workflows
- Implement performance benchmarks with pytest-benchmark
- Add mutation testing to verify test effectiveness
- Create fuzzing tests for parser robustness
- Achieve >90% code coverage for core modules
</developer>
<qe>
- Verify code coverage metrics reach >90%
- Run mutation testing and check kill rate >80%
- Validate property-based tests find edge cases
- Ensure performance benchmarks are reproducible
- Check that all error paths are tested
- Verify concurrent execution tests are reliable
</qe>
<reviewer>
- Confirm test coverage reports are accurate
- Verify tests are not just covering code but testing behavior
- Check that test names clearly describe what they test
- Ensure fixtures are properly scoped and cleaned up
- Validate that tests are deterministic and not flaky
</reviewer>
<tests>
- Unit tests for all public functions
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Property-based tests for invariants
- Performance regression tests
- Concurrent execution tests
