<summary>Introduce UnknownConstruct IR model and reporting pipeline.</summary>
<scope>
- Define UnknownConstruct entity (id/category/location/snippet/normalized/context/impact/cmake_status/suggested_action).
- Add unknown_constructs list onto Project IR and plumb through diagnostics/reporting.
- Extend reports: JSON top-level unknown_constructs DTO; Markdown section summarizing unknown entries; console count summary.</scope>
<developer>
- Implement data classes in IR/diagnostics; generate stable IDs; truncate snippets and normalize compactly.
- Update diagnostics to emit UNKNOWN_CONSTRUCT with severity from impact; ensure migration continues for info/warn.
- Extend report writers (JSON/Markdown/console) to surface unknown constructs without duplication.</developer>
<qe>
- Add unit tests for serialization, diagnostics emission, ID uniqueness, truncation/normalization fallback, and report formatting.
- Validate console count appears; reports include all model fields.</qe>
<reviewer>
- Verify data model matches CR (fields, enums, status defaults); diagnostics severity mapping; no breaking changes to existing reports.
- Check deterministic ordering/IDs and token-conscious payloads.</reviewer>
<tests>
- Commands: `ruff check . && pytest -q`.
- Scenarios: UNKNOWN_CONSTRUCT info/warn/error variations; JSON/Markdown snapshot checks.</tests>
