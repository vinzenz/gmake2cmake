<summary>Reorganize module structure for better code organization</summary>
<scope>
- Components: All modules in gmake2cmake package
- Focus on establishing clear layers and boundaries between modules
</scope>
<developer>
- Create clear module layers: core (domain logic), adapters (external interfaces), utils
- Move all constants to gmake2cmake/constants/ directory
- Create gmake2cmake/types/ for all type definitions
- Separate interfaces (Protocols) from implementations
- Move file operations to adapters/filesystem/
- Move CMake generation to adapters/cmake/
- Ensure no circular dependencies between modules
- Create __init__.py files with proper exports
- Update all imports to use new structure
- Document module responsibilities in README files
</developer>
<qe>
- Verify no circular imports exist
- Test that all imports work correctly
- Validate public API remains unchanged
- Ensure tests still pass after reorganization
- Check that module boundaries are respected
- Verify documentation is updated
</qe>
<reviewer>
- Confirm layered architecture is clear
- Verify separation of concerns is improved
- Check that module cohesion is high
- Ensure coupling between modules is low
- Validate that the new structure is intuitive
- Confirm migration doesn't break functionality
</reviewer>
<tests>
- Import tests for all modules
- Circular dependency detection tests
- Integration tests remain passing
- API compatibility tests
- Documentation generation tests
- Package installation tests
</tests>
