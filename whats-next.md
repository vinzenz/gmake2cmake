- Fill out IRBuilder classifications: internal vs external/imported libs using build rules, tree location, and link_overrides; attach deps from prerequisites; propagate usage requirements (PUBLIC/PRIVATE/INTERFACE) and include/defines/options; ensure aliases used in deps.
- Enhance CMakeEmitter: generate proper target_link_libraries with alias targets, link options, include/define scopes; emit interface/imported targets; flesh out packaging outputs (install/export/Config/Version) with namespace; stabilize global module to avoid include_directories fallback when INTERFACE targets are viable.
- Expand evaluator/parser coverage: conditionals/auto-vars, custom commands, ignored paths; ensure ProjectGlobals capture feature toggles; improve compile inference robustness.
- Add integration fixtures for TS21–TS25 (global config, alias linking internal vs external, INTERFACE/IMPORTED targets, packaging mode, global vs per-target flags); golden-file checks for generated CMake.
- Wire lint (ruff) into CI and optionally add basic README/CLI usage docs; consider adding console scripts entry point in pyproject.
